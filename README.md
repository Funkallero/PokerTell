# PokerTell

**Background**

I play Poker reguarly and I'd like to keep my playing history private but accessible for myself - unfortunately the Poker software I use, provides no easy means to do this.

Thus, I decided to create an application which could *humbly* solve this problem - and hey it was loads of fun as well!

**Purpose**

The purpose of this application is to provide a simple method to keep track of my Poker History.

The application uses https://jsonbin.io API for storage online.

*This means the app requires an active internet connection but it has the benefit of always reading/writing the same batch of data regardless of the client used.*

Contains both a GUI and CLI version.
